## [unreleased] - in progress

- Reworked firewall rules to cover both native applications and ones
  running in Docker containers.  Moved most blocking to the PREROUTING
  chain of the "mangle" table.  This block at lower cost because it is
  earlier in the process, for better performance during packet floods.
  It is also before the split between INPUT (used by native apps) and
  FORWARD (used by Docker) so it covers both.  Also added rules for
  DHCP because connection tracking can break in some situations.

- Reworked fail2ban configuration to allow customization of the jails,
  to change bantimes or retarget to the DOCKER-USER chain.

## [1.1] - 2020-02-18

- Added 'www' user account for uploading website data.  Also reworked
  the website configs to add a variety of extra flags.

- Changed '-' to '_' in backup_server and raspberry_pi group names to
  satisfy new Ansible naming requirements.  Update your host files and
  group_var files to match.  Many lint fixes throughout the playbooks.

- Certbot handling now broken out into a separate role, the renewal
  hooks are now configurable and handled by a few simple variables.
  Now requesting a separate certificate for the mail server.  This
  makes it possible to build a mail-only or web-only server without
  having to rework certbot.

- Simplified HTTPS handling, tightened up SLL parameters, and Apache
  directory permissions.

- backup-server play now brings in the cryptdir role.  Encryption type
  is 'none' by default, set to luks to encrypt the backups at rest.

- bacula_director_bootstart controls whether director starts at boot.
  Starts normally when encryption type is 'none'.
  
- mail_services_bootstart controls whether mail starts at boot.
  Starts normally when encryption type is 'none'.

- web_services_bootstart controls whether apache starts at boot.
  Starts normally but can be overridden if using encryption for the
  document root.

- The first.yml playbook now does sudo on raspberry pis.

## [1.0] - 2020-02-02

- Baseline release.  Mail, web, and backup all working, although there
  may be rough spots here and there
