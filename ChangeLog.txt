## [Unreleased]

- Changed '-' to '_' in backup_server and raspberry_pi group names to
  satisfy new Ansible naming requirements.  Update your host files and
  group_var files to match.  Many lint fixes throughout the playbooks.

- Certbot handling now broken out into a separate role, the renewal
  hooks are now configurable and handled by a few simple variables.
  Now requesting a separate certificate for the mail server.  This
  makes it possible to build a mail-only or web-only server without
  having to rework certbot.

- Simplified HTTPS handling, tightened up SLL parameters, and Apache
  directory permissions.

- backup-server play now brings in the cryptdir role.  Encryption type
  is 'none' by default, set to luks to encrypt the backups at rest.

- bacula_director_bootstart controls whether director starts at boot.
  Starts normally when encryption type is 'none'.
  
- mail_services_bootstart controls whether mail starts at boot.
  Starts normally when encryption type is 'none'.

- web_services_bootstart controls whether apache starts at boot.
  Starts normally but can be overridden if using encryption for the
  document root.

- The first.yml playbook now does sudo on raspberry pis.

## [1.0] - 2020-02-02

- Baseline release.  Mail, web, and backup all working, although there
  may be rough spots here and there
