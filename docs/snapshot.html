<p><b>ROLE</b> snapshot, snapshot.yml playbook

<p>When migrating to a new machine most of the user data like the mail
spool and HTML root directories can be restored from backups once the
machine is up and running.</p>

<p>There are some configuration files that we would prefer to save and
install as part of the first pass configuration by ansible (SLL keys,
the mail users database) rather than recreate then from scratch and
then replace later.</p>

<p>In particular, with the SSL keys, we want to avoid creating a new
account and allocating new keys which we would then abandon and get
warnings about later.  The mail user DB might have new users or
changed passwords that have accumulated over time.  It doesn't matter
much if this is replaced in the second pass, but this way it is good
right out of the box.</p>

<p>The top level snapshot.yml playbook runs this role and populates
the "backup" local directory with subdirectories for every hostname.

<PRE class=code>
$ ansible-playbook -K --ask-vault-pass -i hosts snapshot.yml
</PRE>

<p><b>NOTE</b> - you generally want to get rid of the snapshot
directory after you are done with it so that it does not go stale and
inadvertantly overwrite good data.
