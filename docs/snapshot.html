<H1>Snapshot Unique Config Files</H1>

<p><b>ROLE</b> snapshot, snapshot.yml playbook

<p>When migrating to a new machine most of the user data like the mail
spool and HTML root directories can be restored from backups once the
machine is up and running.</p>

<p>There are some configuration files that we would prefer to save and
install as part of the first pass configuration by ansible (SLL keys,
the mail users database) rather than recreate then from scratch and
then replace later.</p>

<p>In particular, with the SSL keys, we want to avoid creating a new
account and allocating new keys which we would then abandon and get
warnings about later.  The mail user DB might have new users or
changed passwords that have accumulated over time.  It doesn't matter
much if this is replaced in the second pass, but this way it is good
right out of the box.</p>

<p>The <code>snapshot.yml</code> playbook populates the "snapshot"
local directory with a subdirectory for each hostname containing
individual files or tared directories that we want to carry over.  The
various roles called by <code>site.yml</code> check whether this
exists and copies the data if it is present.</p>

<p>When using this, run snapshot.yml to create the snapshot directory,
rebuild the machine, then run site.yml to initialize the new machine.
After the machine is configured, remove the snapshot directory so that
it does not go stale and inadvertantly overwrite good data later on.

<PRE class=code>
# make snapshot/machine.name directory
$ ansible-playbook -K --ask-vault-pass -i hosts snapshot.yml

# wipe/rebuild machine

# initialize the new machine
$ ansible-playbook --ask-pass --ask-vault-pass -i hosts first.yml
$ ansible-playbook -K --ask-vault-pass -i hosts site.yml

# delete snapshot/machine.name directory
</PRE>

<p>We might also want to include the SSH host keys in the snapshot so
that we don't trip up people with the host changed warning.  This is a
bit of a chicken and egg thing though since first login will regen
keys and you will have to clear known_hosts yourself, but might be
worth it if a lot of other people are sshing into the machine for some
reason.
