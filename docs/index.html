<H1>DaveCloud Mail, Web, and Backup</H1>

<p>These Ansible scripts set up mail and web service, with regular
backups to a second machine.  Typically, the server is on
a <a href="machines.html">machine in the cloud</a> while backups are
on an old machine in your house.  My three goals were:</p>
<ol>
<li>Mail and web for one or more domains, 
<li>Built securely with modern packages, and proper backups,
<li>A ground-up understanding of what is on the machine and why.
</ol>

<p>Along the way, I also developed a pretty good knowledge of Ansible.
The <em>what</em> and <em>why</em> are documented in these pages, as a
starting point for your own choices.  If ground-up knowledge is not
one of your priorities, a push-button mail server
like <a href="https://github.com/modoboa/modoboa">Modoboa</a>,
<a href="https://mailinabox.email/">mail-in-a-box</a>, or
<a href="https://github.com/progmaticltd/homebox">homebox</a> is a
fine solution.</p>

<p>I don't include many extra packages, which means fewer things to
understand, a smaller attack surface, and lower machine requirements.
For example, we manage the dozen or so virtual mail accounts using
SQLite rather than a full MySQL install.  This simplifies database
security to just file permissions.</p>


<p>I hope you find this useful as a starting point for
reaching <em>your</em> goals.</p>


<p>TO DO LIST
<UL>
<LI>Configure DKIM with manual entry to  DNS.
<LI>Configure DMARC entry in the DNS.
<LI>Configure DKIM with automatic key rotation.
<LI>Deploy DNS on live machine
<LI>Thunderbird has trouble autoconfiging on virtual domains.   Must set port and passwd type manually.   Also the autoconfiging attempts will trip a fail2ban rule, locking you out.
<LI>Look at apticron or unattended-upgrades for keeping patched.
<LI>Null client switch to cert based auth
<LI>Null client extend SQL to allow reject mail to relay@ - sendonly support to the SQL and recipient-access
<LI>Ipset with a variety of Class As to block port 22 and quiet down
the logs.
<LI>Strip extra headers on outgoing mail
</UL>

<p>Can run dpkg-reconfigure on packages

<H2 class=rule>
<A NAME=pkgs></A>Packages</H2>

<p>These playbooks assume Debian 10.  Other distros should be close,
but may need some changes because of differing file locations or
package versions.  In most cases, I used the
Ansible <code>package:</code> module rather than <code>apt:</code> for
installing things, so it works with package managers like emerge or
yum.
<a href="ansible.html">Why Ansible?</a>
<a href="debian.html">Why Debian?</a></p>

<p>The playbooks cover the following areas: 

<ul>
<li><a href="ssh.html">SSH</a>
<li><a href="firewall.html">Firewall</a>
<li><a href="apache.html">Web Server</a>
<li><a href="mail.html">Mail Server and Clients</a>
<li><a href="encrypt.html">Encryption</a>
<li><a href="dns.html">DNS Configuration</a>
<li><a href="backup.html">Backup</a>
</ul>


<!-- ============================== -->
<H2 class=rule>
<A NAME=start></A>Getting Started</H2>

<p>Check out the <code>davecloud</code> repo.  Make a separate
directory for your settings by recursively copying
<code>hosts.example</code> to someplace <u>outside</u> of the repo.
We call it <code>myhosts</code> here, but any name is fine.

<PRE class=code>
$ https://github.com/david-loffredo/davecloud.git

$ cp -r davecloud/hosts.example myhosts

$ ls
davecloud  myhosts
</PRE>

<p>The new <code>myhosts</code> directory contains
a <a href="#hosts">hosts</a> file and a <a href="#vars">group_vars</a>
directory.  After customizing these as described below, I recommend
putting this directory under source control.  You can do that however
you like because it is completely separate from
the <code>davecloud</code> repo.

<p>If you keep <code>myhosts</code> on Github, I recommend a private
repo.  Passwords will be encrypted in the <code>vault.yml</code> file,
but you probably don't want other inventory detail like IPs, email
addresses and domain names broadly viewable.

<PRE class=code>
$ls -R myhosts/
myhosts/:
group_vars  hosts

myhosts/group_vars:
all

myhosts/group_vars/all:
all.yml  vault.yml
</PRE>

<p>Since all of your settings are kept in a separate, external
directory, you shouldn't need to fork <code>davecloud</code> unless
you want to edit the playbooks to do new things.</p>


<!-- ============================== -->
<H2 class=rule>
<A NAME=hosts></A>Hosts</H2>


<p>The <code>myhosts/hosts</code> file
identifies <a href="machines.html">the machines that you are
managing</a>, and organizes them into groups.  The playbooks describe
tasks and roles that apply to the machines in each group.  We use two
groups: <code>cloud</code> and <code>backup-server</code>.</p>

<p>The machines are listed by fully qualified domain name (FQDN) and
IP address, so the machine does not need to show up in DNS yet.
Ansible uses the <code>ansible_host</code> variable to connect, and
sets the <code>inventory_hostname</code> variable to the FQDN for use
in the scripts.</p>

<PRE class=code>
[cloud]
# mail and webserver, needs a public IP address from a business class
# ISP connection or VPS provider like AWS, Linode, or DigitalOcean
example.com		ansible_host=1.2.3.4

[backup-server]
# connects to other machines to fetch and store backups, best if you
# have physical control of the machine.  It does not need a public IP
# and can be behind a residential ISP connection.
guardian.example.com	ansible_host=5.6.7.8
</PRE>


<!-- ============================== -->
<H2 class=rule>
<A NAME=vars></A>Variables</H2>

<p>The <code>myhosts/group_vars</code> directory contains settings
that apply to the groups of machines in the hosts file.  Ansible looks
for a <code>&lt;group-name&gt;.yml</code> file or
a <code>&lt;group-name&gt;/</code> directory containing any number of
YML files.  Every machine belongs to the special <code>all</code>
group, and we use this group for most of our settings.</p>

<p>Within <code>group_vars/all</code>, we put most of our settings in the
<code>all.yml</code> file.  We put sensitive values like passwords in
<code>vault.yml</code>, which is an encrypted
<a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/vault.html">Ansible
vault file</a>.</p>

<p>The <code>vault.yml</code> that you copied is not yet encrypted and
contains placeholders for a bunch of things.  Edit it to contain real
values and then encrypt it with your own unique password:

<PRE class=code>
$ ansible-vault encrypt vault.yml	# encrypt plain file
</PRE>

<p>The file stays encrypted.  Use the <code>edit</code> command to
open a clear-text version temporarily in <code>$EDITOR</code> to look
at or modify the contents.  You can also change the password
with <code>rekey</code>.</p>

<PRE class=code>
$ ansible-vault edit vault.yml 		# run EDITOR on file
$ ansible-vault rekey vault.yml		# change password on file
</PRE>

<p>To make it easier to find variables, we prefix each value in 
<code>vault.yml</code> with "vault_" and then declare a version
without the prefix in the <code>all.yml</code> file.  For example, a
password might show up as follows:</p>

<PRE class=code>
something_pw: "{{vault_something_pw}}"   # vault_* is in vault.yml
</PRE>

<p>Data is encrypted as AES256 and stored as a block of ASCII text,
similar to ssh keys.  Ansible will decrypt on-the-fly when running
playbooks.  There are many ways to get the password to Ansible, but we
use the <code>--ask-vault-pass</code> flag to type it in every
time.</p>

<p>You shouldn't need anything beyond the <code>all.yml</code>
and <code>vault.yml</code> for this application, but if you extend
these playbooks for other things, be aware
that <a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_variables.html">Ansible
variables</a> have an absurd amount of flexibility.



<!-- ============================== -->
<H2 class=rule>
<A NAME=dns></A>DNS</H2>

<p>Still getting <a href="dns.html">DNS</a> sorted out.  Would like to
eventually self host to make it easier to automatically rotate DKIM
keys, but for the moment just set A, CNAME, and MX entries using your
registrar or other service.</p>


<!-- ============================== -->
<H2 class=rule>
<A NAME=first></A>First Login Playbook</H2>

<p>The first thing to do after provisioning a machine is run the
<code>first.yml</code> playbook to set up a deployment account,
install keys, and then <a href="ssh.html">lock down SSH</a>.

<p>Tasks are executed remotely as <code>root</code>. The
lowercase <code>-k</code> flag is a shorthand
for <code>--ask-pass</code>.  This is the only time a password-based
login ever happens.  Ansible needs the <code>sshpass</code> package on
your local machine to do password-based login to a remote machine.  If
you can pre-install an ssh key for root, you could change this
logic.</p>

<PRE class=code>
$ ansible-playbook -k --ask-vault-pass -i ../myhosts first.yml --limit machinename
</PRE>

<p>After this, remote password login is disabled and everything
requires ssh keys.  All further work uses the deployment account.  It
is a good idea to change or star the root password because the
original passed through your VPS provider's UI.</p>

<!-- ============================== -->
<H2 class=rule>
<A NAME=play></A>Site Setup Playbook</H2>

<p>The <code>site.yml</code> file is the main playbook for our cloud
and backup server machines.  Tasks are executed remotely as
the <code>deploy</code> user, so Ansible needs passwords for the
deploy user (for sudo) and the vault (for decrypting).  The
uppercase <code>-K</code> flag is a shorthand
for <code>--ask-become-pass</code></p>

<p>Ansible playbooks are meant to be idempotent, which means that they
are supposed to leave a machine in a given state, no matter how many
times you run it or what state it was in before.</p>

<PRE class=code>
$ ansible-playbook -K --ask-vault-pass -i ../myhosts site.yml
</PRE>

<p>By default, Ansible runs the playbook on all machines in the
inventory file.  We can limit it to a certain group or machine with
the <code>--limit</code> flag.  We can also select just parts of the
playbook with the <code>--tags</code> flag.</p>

<PRE class=code>
# run the playbook only on the cloud group
$ ansible-playbook -K --ask-vault-pass -i ../myhosts site.yml --limit cloud

# run apache tagged tasks only on the cloud group
$ ansible-playbook -K --ask-vault-pass -i ../myhosts site.yml \
    --limit cloud  --tags apache
</PRE>

<p>Most roles have their own tags, so you can call them selectively.
There is another <a href="snapshot.html">snapshot</a> tag that copies
back certain system data like keys and certs for easy transfer when
wiping or migrating a machine.</p>


<!-- ============================== -->
<H2 class=rule>
<A NAME=reboot></A>Rebooting</H2>

<p>The machine should boot clean and everything will come up except
mail.  Because the mail spool is encrypted, you must log in,
run <code>/etc/postfix/mailboot</code> to enter the EncFS password.
This will mount the cleartext directories and start postfix.</p>

alternative to a VPS in the cloud.  I wouldn't run SunOS 4.1.3 though,
as that is a little old.
