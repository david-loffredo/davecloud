<H1>Server Configuration</H1>

<p>These are Ansible roles that I have built for my own use.  Most
were inspired by similar roles in sovereign, homebox, or frjo's
ansible setups.  They assume that you are using Debian 9.

<p>Common configurations including things like firewall, dns and
ntp. I add this role to all my playbooks, hence the name.

<p>TO DO LIST
<UL>
<LI>Test with Debian 10
<LI>Deploy DNS on live machine
<LI>Configure DKIM and automate key rotation with postfix and DNS.
<LI>Configure RSPAMD with postfix.
<LI>Configure DMARC entry in the DNS.
<LI>Configure borg for backups, possibly rsync to block storage on
linode, might also move the mail spool to linode block storage for
easier expansion.
<LI>Cut over on actual sites.
</UL>

<!-- ============================== -->
<H2 class=rule>
<A NAME=first></A>First Login</H2>

<p>The first thing you should do after provisioning any machine is run
the first.yml playbook to lock down SSH.  This should be the only time
a password based login is used with the machine.  You need "sshpass"
installed locally because the remote machine does not yet have any
keys installed.  After this, remote password login is disabled and
everything uses ssh keys.  It is also a good idea to change the root
password manually because the original passed through the Linode UI.

<PRE class=code>
$ export ANSIBLE_HOST_KEY_CHECKING=False
$ ansible-playbook --ask-pass --ask-vault-pass -i hosts first.yml
</PRE>

<p>The public key needs to be in single line openssh form; to convert
a verbose key from putty, do:

<PRE class=code>
$ ssh-keygen -i -f yourputtypubkeyfile > openssh.key
</PRE>

<!-- ============================== -->
<H2 class=rule>
<A NAME=play></A>Run Playbook</H2>

<p>This runs the site playbook on all machines in the 'hosts'
inventory file.  It runs as the deploy user and asks passwords for
sudo on the deploy user and the vault password.  Both are the stpbuild
passwords.  The <code>-K</code> flag is a shorthand
for <code>--ask-become-pass</code>

<PRE class=code>
$ ansible-playbook -K --ask-vault-pass -i hosts site.yml
</PRE>

<p>Debian uses <code>apt</code> as the package manager.  To completely
uninstall and reinstall a package.

<PRE class=code>
apt-get --purge remove &lt;pkg&gt;
apt-get install &lt;pkg&gt;
</PRE>

<!-- ============================== -->
<H2 class=rule>
<A NAME=vars></A>Variables</H2>

<p>The ansible variables are located under the <b>group_vars</b>
directory.  Right now we are just using a single <b>all</b> set, but
you can get fancier if you have multiple machines and want to track
more variations.</p>

<p>Private information like passwords and such are stored encrypted in a
<a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/vault.html">vault
file</a>.  Ansible asks for the password to this when
the <code>--ask-vault-pass</code> flag is given.  You can edit and
manipulate it from the command line with:
<PRE class=code>
ansible-vault edit foo.yml 		# run EDITOR on file

ansible-vault rekey foo.yml 		# change password on file
ansible-vault encrypt foo.yml 		# encrypt plain file
ansible-vault decrypt foo.yml 		# convert encrypted to plain file
</PRE>

<p>To make it easier to keep track of everything, the cleartext vars
file has a stub for each value hidden in the vault.  The stub simply
references a similar variable with a "vault_" prefix that is stored in
the encrypted vault file.  For example, a password might show up like
the following in the cleartext file.

<PRE class=code>
  - email: "somebody@foobar.com"
    pw: "{{vault_mbox_someone_pw}}"
