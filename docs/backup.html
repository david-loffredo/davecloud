<p><b>ROLE</b> backup

<p>The host backup configuration is handled by the "backup" role.  We
use <a href="https://www.borgbackup.org/">Borg</a> as the backup agent
because it has a nice list of features like deduplication, encryption,
and a good community.</p>

<p>We will back up the list of config files covered by
the <a href="snapshot.html">snapshot</a> playbook, plus the mail
spool.  May or may not back up the document roots for the web sites.
Is it worth it to back up logs?


<p>For the backup location, we could do local disk or a remote ssh
borg server like supplied
by <a href="https://www.rsync.net/products/borg.html">rsync.net</a>.
Direct to an S3 bucket is not currently supported by borg, but you
could go to local disk and rclone sync as described in
<a href="https://opensource.com/article/17/10/backing-your-machines-borg">this
article</a>, but this still requires double local disk space.
