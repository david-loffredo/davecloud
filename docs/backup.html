<H1>Backup</H1>

<p><b>ROLE</b> bacula-client

<p>We use <a href="https://www.bacula.org/">Bacula</a> to manage
backups.  On the machine to be backed up, this is enabled by the
"bacula-client" role.  The backups are then initiated by and stored on
a separate director machine.</p>

<p>Since the client is in the cloud and our director will likely be
NATed and behind a firewall, we leave the Bacula ports blocked on the
client and have the director set up an ssh tunnel.  We use a
restricted backup account with a separate ssh key just to set up the
tunnel to port 9102.</p>

<p>We will back up the list of config files covered by
the <a href="snapshot.html">snapshot</a> playbook, plus the mail
spool.  May or may not back up the document roots for the web sites.
Is it worth it to back up logs?


<h2>Why I chose Bacula</h2>

<p>When starting this process, I was originally planning to
use <a href="https://www.borgbackup.org/">Borg</a> as the backup agent
because it has a nice list of features like deduplication, encryption,
and a good community.  Once I started considered <em>where</em> my
backups would live, I changed my mind.

<p>Borg can back up to local disk or over SSH to a server like
by <a href="https://www.rsync.net/products/borg.html">rsync.net</a>.
Borg won't go to an S3 bucket, but a similar project called
<a href="https://restic.net/">Restic</a> will.

<p>These client-driven backups do a great job guarding against a disk
crash or mistake, but offer no protection for a p0wned machine.  If
the client can access past backups for pruning, etc, an attacker can
mess with them too.  Borg has an append-only mode that is supposed to
help with this, but all it does is queue deletions until a trusted
machine tries to do something.  This takes automated pruning right off
the table because you might not know the machine was compromised until
too late.

<p>So after considering all of these factors, I fell back to the
gold-standard of Bacula, which covers oopsie and p0wnage, has a bunch
of storage options, including tape, which none of the new kids even
acknowedge the existance of.  It requires setting up more than one
machine, but a $10 Rapsberry Pi Zero sitting on a shelf is more than
adaquate for backing up a personal email/web server.
