<H1>Mail Server</H1>

<p><b>ROLE</b> mailhost

<p>The <code>mailhost</code> role configures a machine as a mail
server.  It receives mail from the outside world and delivers to
mailboxes accessible via IMAP.  We use Postfix for the mail transfer
agent (MTA) and Dovecot as the local delivery agent (LDA) and IMAP
server.  Rspamd is the only milter used, for spam filtering and DKIM
signing.  The <a href="mailnull.html">mailnull</a> role is used on
other machines, like the backup server, to relay mail through the
central server.</p>

<p>All accounts are virtual mailboxes.  The machine only has system
unix accounts and no mail is delivered to them.  The virtual user
database holds account details in a set of SQL tables.  Background on
virtual users can be found
at <a href="http://www.postfix.org/VIRTUAL_README.html">postfix.org</a>
You can manage users with the <a href="#mailcfg">mailcfg</a> script.
This is a perl script that uses DBI, so you can tweak the connect
statement and SQL as needed for use with other RDBs.</p>

<p>The mail is stored in maildir format and in
an <a href="encrypt.html">encrypted directory or partition</a>.  When
using EncFS, the encrypted directory is <code>/var/vmail_crypt</code>
and mounted as cleartext in <code>/var/vmail</code>.  All mail is
owned by the
<code>vmail</code> user.</p>

<p>We use SQLite for the database because this is small, simple, and
relatively static, but you can use MySQL, Maria, or Postgres if you
prefer.  On Debian, smtpd runs chrooted
to <code>/var/spool/postfix</code>, so we
store <code>maildb.sqlite3</code> encrypted like the mail in
<code>/var/spool/postfix/etc/maildb_crypt</code>
and <code>maildb</code> so that postfix can authenticate against it.
If you also run dovecot chrooted, you may have to switch to mysql so
that you can access via network port rather than file.</p>

<p>On reboot, postfix does not start automatically because these
encrypted directories must first be mounted.  Log in and run
<code>/etc/postfix/mailboot</code> to enter the password, mount the
cleartext directories, and start postfix.</p>


<!-- ============================== -->
<H2 class=rule>
<A NAME=vars></A>Variables</H2>

<p>The <code>mail_server_hostname</code> is what the machine
identifies itself as and where <a href="mailnull.html machines">client
machines</a> try to relay their mail.  The <code>mail_spool_pw</code>
is the password for encryption on the mail spool and is usually kept
in the vault file.


<PRE class=code>
mail_server_hostname: "mail.{{ domain }}"

mail_spool_pw: "{{vault_crypt_pw}}"
</PRE>

<p>The <code>mail_domains</code> and <code>mail_users</code> lists
give the domains that we should accept mail for and the virtual users
and initial passwords for those users.  

<PRE class=code>
mail_domains:
  - "{{ domain }}"
  - second.example

mail_users:
  - email: "{{ admin_email }}"
    pw: "{{vault_mbox_admin_pw}}"
  - email: "relay@{{ domain }}"
    pw: "{{vault_relay_pw}}"
  - email: "user1@{{ domain }}"
    pw: "{{vault_mbox_user1_pw}}"
  - email: "user2@second.example"
    pw: "{{vault_mbox_user2_pw}}"
</PRE>


<p>Define your mail aliases with the <code>mail_aliases</code> list of
src/dst pairs.  We automatically add aliases to
the <code>admin_email</code> for a list of system addresses for each
domain.  These system aliases include 'root', 'abuse', 'postmaster',
etc. and is given by <code>mail_local_admin_aliases</code>.</p>

<PRE class=code>
mail_aliases: 
   - { src: "source@domain",         dst: "dest@domain" }
</PRE>

<p>If you want DKIM signing, the <code>dkim_selector</code>, usually
following a year month pattern (202001) so that we have a predictable
pattern when we rotate them.  This enables signing and generates the
keys in the <code>dkim_keyroot</code> directory, which defaults to
being under the mail spool.  The .txt files there contain the entries
to add to the DNS zones.</p>

<p>When near rotation time, we can set <code>dkim_selector_next</code>
to pre-generate the keys, but not use them.  This gives us a chance to
get the public keys into DNS and let them propagate.</p>

<PRE class=code>
dkim_selector: 202001
dkim_selector_next:
</PRE>






<!-- ============================== -->
<H2 class=rule>
<A NAME=mailcfg></A>Mailcfg</H2>

<p>The virtual user database is initialized as described above but you
can do additional things with the <b>/etc/postfix/mailcfg</b> perl
script.  Run it as "mailcfg &lt;command&gt;".  The following commands
are available:</p>

<PRE class=code>
 help		Print this message

 addalias &lt;src&gt; &lt;dst&gt;	Adds alias if missing
 adddom &lt;dom&gt;		Add domain if missing
 adduser &lt;email&gt; &lt;pw&gt;	Adds user if missing

 lsalias [&lt;dom&gt;]	List aliases, all or for a domain
 lsdom			List known domain
 lsuser [&lt;dom&gt;]		List users, all or for a domain

 rmalias &lt;src&gt;		Remove alias
 rmalias -id &lt;num&gt;	Remove alias with given id
 rmdom &lt;dom&gt;		Remove domain
 rmuser &lt;email&gt; 	Removes user

 passwd &lt;email&gt; &lt;pw&gt;	Changes user password 
 disable &lt;email&gt;	Marks user as inactive
 enable &lt;email&gt;		Marks user as active
</PRE>

<H2 class=rule>
<A NAME=rspamd></A>Spam Filtering</H2>

<p>We use <a href="https://rspamd.com/">rspamd</a> to filter spam.
This hooks into postfix as a milter and includes specific rules
similar to SpamAssasin and Bayesean classification similar to the old
Dspam project.  It does both quite quickly.  Because it is run as a
milter, it can reject the very bad spam before it is accepted for
processing.</p>

<p>We use the sieve module under dovecot to deliver messages marked as
spam to the <code>Junk</code> folder.  It trains the Bayes filter on
any good message delivered to the inbox.  We also add IMAP sieve
scripts to retrain the Bayes classifier when mail is dragged into or
out of the Junk folder.  The sieve scripts are near the mail spool in
the location given by the <code>sieve_root</code> variable.  You can
also add your own personal sieve scripts.

<p>Statistics and fine-grain control are available on the rspamd web
console at <code>http://localhost:11334</code>.  That port is normally
blocked and the server only allows connections from localhost.  Set up
an SSH tunnel to use it.  Either do it from the command line or you
can add the following to the ssh config file for that machine.</p>

<PRE class=code>
LocalForward 11334 localhost:11334
</PRE>

<p>We keep per-user Bayes training data, because everyone has a
different definition of spam.  Right now we do everything during
milting and rspamd picks the first of multiple recipients for the
statistics.</p>

<p>It would be better to disable Bayes during milting, then classify
during delivery, when we have one recipient.  However, we should carry
over the score from milting.  I can turn classification on and off
in <code>settings.conf</code>, but haven't figured out how to carry
over the score.  Probably needs to be done in a Lua plugin.  For the
future.</p>

<p>This also has the nice property that we only reject on objective
criteria found during the milter pass, and can at most quarantine
based on the subjective criteria of the Bayes.</p>


<!-- ============================== -->
<H2 class=rule>
<A NAME=mailq></A>Managing the Mail Queue</H2>

<p>To inspect and manipulate mail queue, the following commands are
helpful.  You can list and flush the queue as any user, but to delete
you must be root.</p>

<PRE class=code>
List the contents of the mail queue
# mailq

Flush the queue (try to deliver mail)
# postfix flush

Delete everything in the queue
# postsuper -d ALL

Delete only deferred mail, that would otherwise retry later
# postsuper -d ALL deferred

You can also look at a particular message ID in the queue
# postcat -vq XXXXXXXXXX
</PRE>

<H2 class=rule>
<A NAME=why></A>Why These Packages?</H2>

<p>Back when dinosaurs walked the Earth, there was one mailer, its
name was Sendmail, and it was configured by the black speech of
M4-dor, which I will not utter here.  If you were lucky you had a
leased line, but more often than not a couple of times a day you
dialed in and swapped all of your messages via uucp.</p>

<p>OK, Boomer moment over.  I really <b>did not</b> want to set up a
system around Sendmail.  I could do that and it still works well, but
great options exist that don't predate the fall of N&uacute;menor.</p>

<p>As of this writing, the top three MTAs by number of servers are
Exim (580k), Postfix (328k), and Sendmail (80k).  Of course, that says
nothing about the volume of mail passing through each server, but it
does give an idea of the general level of support.</p>

<p>The default MTA for Debian is exim4, and it is capable.  I did some
tests setting it up as a null client.  Ultimately, I chose Postfix.
It is easy to find documentation for all of the use cases that
interest me, has ample performance, and reasonable configuration
files. It also supports the milter interface introduced by Sendmail,
which is very nice for rejecting spam early in the connection.</p>

<p>Dovecot is the customary choice for Local Delivery Agent and IMAP
server.  It seems like Cyrus and Courier are other possibilities but I
have no familiarity with them.</p>

<p>I currently use EncFS to <a href="encrypt.html">encrypt the
mailspool</a>.  It works, but I had some problems with "Error:
Couldn't create mailbox list lock file_create_locked() failed".  This
is probably an interaction with EncFS and FUSE, and changing
the <b>lock_method</b> to "dotlock" instead of the default (fcntl)
seemed to fix the issue.  I would like to eventually switch to luks or
ext4 encryption and fscrypt, which operate at a block level.</p>
