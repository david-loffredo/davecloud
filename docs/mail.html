<H1>Mail</H1>

<p><b>ROLE</b> mail

<p>The email configuration is handled by the "mail" role.  Postfix is
used as the MTA and Dovecot for the LDA and IMAP server.  Rspamd is
the only milter used.

<p>All accounts are virtual mailboxes.  The machine only has system unix
accounts and no mail is delivered to them.  The virtual user database
holds the account details in a set of SQL tables.  Some background can
be found at:

<blockquote>
   <a href="http://www.postfix.org/VIRTUAL_README.html">http://www.postfix.org/VIRTUAL_README.html</a>
</blockquote>


<p>We use SQLite for the database because this is small, simple, and
relatively static, but you can use MySQL, Maria, or Postgres if you
prefer.  I've written the mailcfg perl utility to manage the database.
It uses DBI and might just need minor changes to the connect statement
and SQL for use with other RDBs.  The utility is in /etc/postfix, and
is run as "mailcfg &lt;command&gt;".  The following commands are available:

<PRE class=code>
 help		Print this message

 addalias &lt;src&gt; &lt;dst&gt;	Adds alias if missing
 adddom &lt;dom&gt;		Add domain if missing
 adduser &lt;email&gt; &lt;pw&gt;	Adds user if missing

 lsalias [&lt;dom&gt;]	List aliases, all or for a domain
 lsdom			List known domain
 lsuser [&lt;dom&gt;]		List users, all or for a domain

 rmalias &lt;src&gt;		Remove alias
 rmalias -id &lt;num&gt;	Remove alias with given id
 rmdom &lt;dom&gt;		Remove domain
 rmuser &lt;email&gt; 	Removes user

 passwd &lt;email&gt; &lt;pw&gt;	Changes user password 
 disable &lt;email&gt;	Marks user as inactive
 enable &lt;email&gt;		Marks user as active
</PRE>
 
<p>On Debian, smtpd normally runs chrooted to /var/spool/postfix, so
the maildb.sqlite3 database is kept there so the postfix can
authenticate against it.  If you also run dovecot chrooted, you may
have to switch to mysql so that you can access via network port rather
than file.

<p>Mail is stored in maildir format and encrypted using EncFS.  The
encrypted directory is /var/mail_crypt and mounted as cleartext in
/var/mail_clear.  All mail is owned by the vmail user.

<p>Postfix is not started automatically at boot because the encrypted
spool must first be mounted manually.  Log in and run the "mailboot"
script to decrypt the mail spool and start postfix.


<h2>FUTURE WORK -- MILTERS NOT YET IMPLEMENTED</h2>

<p>Mail delivery looks like this:

<PRE>
  Remote MTA -> Rspamd (milter) -> Postfix -> Rspamd (rspamc) -> Dovecot -> user mailbox
</PRE>

<p>Mail from the remote MTA is received by Postfix and run through
Rspamd.  Greylisting and rejects happen in this pipeline.  Once
Postfix receives the message, it is sent to Dovecot over LMTP.
Dovecot uses the antispam module to run rspamc (employing Rspamd).
The sieve module is finally used to process headers added by Rspamd or
any other milters.

## Mail filters

The only mail filter (milter) used is [Rspamd](https://rspamd.com),
which runs on port 11332.  Rspamd is hooked into postfix with the
`smtpd_milters` variable.  See `etc_postfix_main.cf`.

## Debugging

### Rspamd

A few tips:

- Rspam's console listens on `127.0.0.1:11334`.  As above, you can use
  ssh to port forward (e.g., -L 8080:localhost:11334).  The password is `d1`.
- Use `rspamadm` to look at the configuration.
- Use `rspamc` or the web-based console to scan problematic messages
  and see how rspamd scores them.

### DMARC

For verifying DMARC operation, read the rpsamd log in
`/var/log/rspamd` to verify the report generator is running.

For receiving reports, you will get an email if a message comes from
your server that fails authentication (although by configuring
`p=none`, any such email should not be rejected by the other
server).
