<H1>Why Debian?</H1>

<p>I have happily used Gentoo, Centos, Mint, and other distros going
back to boot floppies.  I've also used every iteration of Windows and
MacOS, old school picks like SunOS, Solaris, HP-UX, AIX, IRIX, and
even VMS.  I don't hold strong opinions on operating systems (but
editors are a different story - I didn't grow that extra meta-finger
for nothing!)</p>

<p>I chose Debian because of numbers &mdash; 80% of the examples that
I ran across tended to focus on Debian, and it is the base for over a
hundred other downstream distros, like Ubuntu and Mint.  I started
with Debian 9 (Stretch) but moved to Debian 10 (Buster) shortly after
it was released.</p>

<p>The Debian website has a catalog of
<a href="https://www.debian.org/distrib/packages">all available
packages</a>, and a
<a href="https://backports.debian.org/Packages/">backports catalog</a>
with newer versions of certain packages.</p>

<p>I advise using Ansible for any additions, but while prototyping,
occasional calls to the <code>apt</code> package manager come in
handy:</p>

<PRE class=code>
apt list --installed       # all installed packages
apt list &lt;pkg&gt;
apt list &lt;pkg&gt; -a    # list all versions in the repo

# to completely uninstall and reinstall a package.
apt-get --purge remove &lt;pkg&gt;
apt-get install &lt;pkg&gt;
</PRE>
