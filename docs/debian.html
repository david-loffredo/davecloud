<H1>Debian</H1>

<p>Why Debian?  When starting this work, I didn't really have strong
opinions on a distro.  In recent years, I have happily used Gentoo,
Centos and Mint on a daily basis.  The main reason is just numbers
&mdash; 80% of the examples that I ran across tended to be for Debian,
and it is the base for over a hundred other downstream distros, like
Ubuntu and Mint.  I started with Debian 9 (Stretch) but moved to
Debian 10 (Buster) shortly after it was released.

<p>The Debian website has a catalog of
<a href="https://www.debian.org/distrib/packages">all available
packages</a>, and a
<a href="https://backports.debian.org/Packages/">backports catalog</a>
with newer versions of certain packages.</p>

<p>I advise using Ansible for any additions, but while prototyping,
occasional calls to the <code>apt</code> package manager come in
handy:

<PRE class=code>
apt list --installed       # all installed packages
apt list &lt;pkg&gt;
apt list &lt;pkg&gt; -a    # list all versions in the repo

# to completely uninstall and reinstall a package.
apt-get --purge remove &lt;pkg&gt;
apt-get install &lt;pkg&gt;
</PRE>
