<H1>DNS Configuration</H1>

<p>Originally I just used my registrars DNS service and added records
using their web form.  This worked fine during the initial testing but
when it came time to advertize DKIM records, best practice says they
should be rotated periodically.  I decided to set up bind and make the
machine the DNS master for all domains, then automate DKIM rotation.

<p>I wanted to do DNSSEC, and the homebox config that I started with
can set that up, but it is difficult to find anyone that will support
secondary DNS with DNSSEC.  DNSMadeEasy ($30/yr), BuddyNS ($18/mo),
and the Bulgarian CloudNS claim to do it, but they do not even have it
configured properly for their own domains.   

<p>At the moment, the choice seems to be DNSSEC and run your own one
or two servers that could be DDOSed, or none and use broadly available
secondaries.  It also seems that key rotation is a big problem.  Mail
in a box has probably the best setup and even they do not do it
because of the potential for DNS outages.</p>

<p>We will probably use Linode's and BuddyNS nameservers as slaves.
For Linode, you need to go into their domain manager and add each
domain as a slave, pointing it to the master.  Allow AXFR/IXFR from
ns1-ns5.linode.com and add them to your domain's authoritative
nameservers.  Configure notifies for ns1-ns5.linode.com

<p>In order for Linodeâ€™s DNS servers to function as slaves, your DNS
master server must notify and allow AXFR requests from the following
IP addresses:

<p>Linode machines run a network helper at each boot to set up
/etc/network/interfaces and /etc/resolv.conf for the machine.  It sets
the resolv.conf for the Linode DNS servers, but if we want to use our
own local DNS, we have to turn off that network helper for the
machine.  Then we can can configure theirs as the forward address and
use our local one.

<p>DNS entries can be used to tell mail clients how to configure
themselves.  This is documented in RFC 6186 The listings below say use
imaps and imap is not supported.  Imaps has the lower priority than
pop3s so that is indicated as preferred.

       _imaps._tcp    SRV  0 1 993 imap.example.com.
       _pop3._tcp     SRV  0 0 0   .
       _pop3s._tcp    SRV 10 1 995 pop3.example.com.

 _submission._tcp     SRV 0 1 587 mail.example.com.

<p>DNS propogation may take upto 48 hours. This can be monitored and
checked on <a href="https://www.whatsmydns.net">www.whatsmydns.net</a>, 
<a href="https://dnschecker.org">dnschecker.org</a>, or from the
command line:
<PRE class=code>
root@foo /etc/network# host main.hmbx.pw 1.1.1.1

Address: 1.1.1.1#53
Aliases:

Host main.hmbx.pw not found: 2(SERVFAIL)

<b>OR</b>

main.rodier.me has address 92.19.253.41

HOMEBOX DOCS

The default configuration for the DNS server comes with the following options:

- Installed by default
- Forward to google and cloudflare DNS
- DNSSEC Not activated by default

Default options for the server:

```yaml
bind_default:
  # Bind is actually in testing phase, feedback welcome
  install: true
  # Default servers to forward queries
  forward:
    - 8.8.8.8
    - 8.8.4.4
    - 1.1.1.1
  # Actually, reverse IP address creation only works for IPv4
  # If you are using IPv6, create the reverse IP block here
  reverse_ip: auto
  # Timing configuration (see https://www.ripe.net/publications/docs/ripe-203)
  refresh: 86400          # 24 hours
  retry: 7200             # 2 hours
  expire: 3600000         # 10000 hours
  neg_cache_ttl: 172800   # 2 days
  ttl: 3600               # 1 hour
  # General configuration
  mx_priority: 10
  # List of backup MX records, if the server is unreachable
  # The default is an empty list
  mx_backup: []
  # Example of records
  # mx_backup:
  #   - fqdn: spool.mail.gandi.net
  #     priority: 10
  #   - fqdn: fb.mail.gandi.net
  #     priority: 50
  # List of trusted servers to accept cache / recursive queries
  trusted:
    - src: 192.168.0.0/16
      comment: LAN
    - src: localhost
    - src: localnets
      comment: Local networks
  #  - src: 72.13.58.64
  #    comment: https://dnssec-analyzer.verisignlabs.com
  # DNSSEC options
  dnssec:
    active: false
    algo: RSASHA256

```

# Forwarding queries

By default, the Google public DNS servers are used, as well as the one from cloudflare.

More choice here: [Public DNS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Public_DNS#See_also).

# Backup MX records

If your server is not online, for instance due to an internet outage, you can use this option to redirect emails
reception to another server. In this case, the other MTA should be configured to accept emails for your domain.

If you use this option, you will probably consider importing the emails delivered to these "backup servers", to your own
server, using the [external account](external-accounts.md) functionality.

# Trusted servers

Enter the list of trusted servers for recursion and cache query.

# DNSSEC extensions

DNSSEC is not activated by default. Be sure your domain name supports it before activating it.
