<H1>DNS Configuration</H1>

<p>Originally I just used my registrars DNS service and added records
using their web form.  This worked fine during the initial testing but
when it came time to advertize DKIM records, best practice says they
should be rotated periodically.

<p>It would be tedious to do that manually, so I decided to set up
bind and make the machine the authoritative DNS source for all of the
domains.  This configuration is mostly stolen from homebox, because
they have a nice setup that handles DNSSEC.

The default configuration for the DNS server comes with the following options:

- Installed by default
- Forward to google and cloudflare DNS
- DNSSEC Not activated by default

Default options for the server:

```yaml
bind_default:
  # Bind is actually in testing phase, feedback welcome
  install: true
  # Default servers to forward queries
  forward:
    - 8.8.8.8
    - 8.8.4.4
    - 1.1.1.1
  # Actually, reverse IP address creation only works for IPv4
  # If you are using IPv6, create the reverse IP block here
  reverse_ip: auto
  # Timing configuration (see https://www.ripe.net/publications/docs/ripe-203)
  refresh: 86400          # 24 hours
  retry: 7200             # 2 hours
  expire: 3600000         # 10000 hours
  neg_cache_ttl: 172800   # 2 days
  ttl: 3600               # 1 hour
  # General configuration
  mx_priority: 10

  # DNSSEC options
  dnssec:
    active: false
    algo: RSASHA256

```

# Forwarding queries

By default, the Google public DNS servers are used, as well as the one from cloudflare.

More choice here: [Public DNS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Public_DNS#See_also).

# Backup MX records

If your server is not online, for instance due to an internet outage, you can use this option to redirect emails
reception to another server. In this case, the other MTA should be configured to accept emails for your domain.

If you use this option, you will probably consider importing the emails delivered to these "backup servers", to your own
server, using the [external account](external-accounts.md) functionality.

# Trusted servers

Enter the list of trusted servers for recursion and cache query.

# DNSSEC extensions

DNSSEC is not activated by default. Be sure your domain name supports it before activating it.
