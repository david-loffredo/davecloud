<p><b>ROLE</b> common, firewall.yml

<p>This uses raw iptables and uses iptables-persistent to reload our
config on boot.  The playbook writes our IPv4 and IPv6 rules to the
following,
<PRE>
    /etc/iptables/testrules.v4
    /etc/iptables/testrules.v6
</PRE>

<p>It then runs iptables-restore/iptables-save to cycle them into the
corresponding rules.v* files, which are what is loaded on boot.  To
change rules, edit etc/iptables/testrules.v* in the templates dir and
rerun the playbook.


<p>We run fail2ban to scan the logs for repeated intrusion attempts
and temporarily ban IPs.

<p>Open ports for new services by setting 'firewall_services'.  This
is checked by the iptables and fail2ban tasks.  It recongizes ssh,
mail, web, and dns, but you can add your own names to this list.  For
each element, we add &lt;name&gt;_opentcp and &lt;name&gt;_openudp, if
they exist, to the open ports.  Define &lt;name&gt;_opentcp/udp as a
list of ports.
<PRE class=code>
firewall_services: [ 'ssh' ]

# will append ports from the mnemonic list of services but can be
# initialized with extra ports.
firewall_opentcp: []
firewall_openudp: []
  
# blocked if defined
firewall_blacklist_ips: []
</PRE>

<p>Some people install the ufw front end, which makes it easier to
block everything and open up a few ports.  It seemed that UFW took
over everything, which makes it difficult to do other iptables stuff
like ipsets to geoblock china, russia, etc.  However, a closer read of
the docs shows that it just manages iptables-save files that are in
etc, so we could use it and add whatever we want.  Look at the
following two files.

<p>/etc/ufw/after.init: initialization customization script run after ufw is initialized (ufw 0.34 and later)
<p>/etc/ufw/before.init: initialization customization script run before ufw is initialized (ufw 0.34 and later)

<p>You still have to be careful with UFW though.  It remembers the
state, so idempotency is sketchy.  If you have a dozen ports open and
then remove a bunch from your variables, your task will set the
remaining ones, but the originals will remain open until you do an
explicit ufw reset and then rerun the task.  Our current iptables task
is totally idempotent.


<p>Fail2ban helps a bit on password protected service like IMAP by
limiting the number of attempts an attacker can make before switching
IPs, but is more noise control for the logs than security.

Debian 10 has a fairly recent package so we use it stock and
enable checks for sshd, dovecot, postfix and a few others depending on
what services are present.  The version in Debian 9 was old, so we
previously added some custom patterns for ssh.
