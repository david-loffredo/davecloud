<p><b>ROLE</b> common, iptable.yml

<p>This uses raw iptables.  Some people install the ufw front end,
which makes it easier to block everything and open up a few ports.
Since we might eventually geoblock china, russia, etc. we stick to raw
iptables so that we can use includes and ipset.  We use
iptables-persistent to reload our config on boot.

<p>The playbook writes our IPv4 and IPv6 rules to the following,

<PRE>
    /etc/iptables/testrules.v4
    /etc/iptables/testrules.v6
</PRE>

<p>It then runs iptables-restore/iptables-save to cycle them into the
corresponding rules.v* files, which are what is loaded on boot.  To
change rules, edit etc/iptables/testrules.v* in the templates dir and
rerun the playbook.

<p>We run fail2ban to scan the logs for repeated intrusion attempts
and temporarily ban IPs.  Debian 10 has a fairly updated package so we
use it stock and enable checks for sshd, dovecot, postfix and a few
others.  The Debian 9 version was old so before we switched, we needed
to add some custom patterns for ssh.
