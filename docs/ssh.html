<H1>SSH Configuration</H1>

<p><b>ROLE</b> first

<p>As part of the initial setup of any machine, we lock down access
via SSH, harden it by disabling some weak algorithms, and set up
a <code>deploy</code> user with sudo access that is used instead
of <code>root</code> for administration tasks.</p>

<p>SSH is configured so that all remote access requires a key.
Password-based login is only allowed from the console.  When multiple
people need administrative access to your machines, I recommend
authorizing separate public keys for each person rather than sharing
one private key.  With Ansible, you can easily maintain a list of
authorized keys on all of your machines.</p>

<p>Whether to have a separate deploy account or just use root for
everything is a personal preference.  Having a separate step to
elevate permissions may avoid some accidents, and if a private key is
compromised, an attacker still needs the deploy password to sudo.
Raspberian follows this pattern with the <code>pi</code> account. On
Pi's, we remove the <code>pi</code> account after creating
the <code>deploy</code> one.</p>

<p>We also do some hardening of the SSH server by disabling weak
protocols.  Since encryption is a constantly changing battlefield, I
recommend getting a "yearly Flu shot" by occasionally scanning the
server with tools
like <a href="https://github.com/jtesta/ssh-audit">ssh-audit</a>
or <a href="https://github.com/CISOfy/lynis">Lynis</a> as 
discussed in the <a href="encrypt.html">encryption configuration</a>.
