I've been around the net since before HTTP was a thing, but let my
sysadmin skills get stale as others handled those duties.  It was time
to refresh.  This project is the result of that journey.


<p>I began this project by studying sovereign, homebox, mail in a box,
frjo's ansible setups and a variety of other resources.  It is easy to
fall into the cargo cult sysadmin trap by just following recipes, so I
tried to use them as inspiration, examine all of the design decisions,
and then make my own conscious decisions, which I have documented here
and in the YML files.  I was also forced to develop a much deeper
understanding of Ansible, particularly for configuring the network of
machines and services required for Bacula to operate properly.</p>



<p>If you need to specify some parameters before a batch install, you
can use the debconf module.  Typically we install then configure, but
this might be useful in certain situations.
