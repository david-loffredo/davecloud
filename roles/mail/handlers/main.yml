# Do not start postfix at boot, Wait until the encrypted spool is
# mounted.  Our "mailboot" script mounts and starts.  The "enabled"
# value of "no" below should disable this.

# This should run "sudo update-rc.d postfix disable" and remove the
# postfix links from rc3.d/ and rc5.d/S01postfix.  Verify.
