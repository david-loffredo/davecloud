# Simple SQLite query for mail aliases.  If an address expands to
# multiple destination, the table will have one row for each.  So src
# alone is not unique, but src+dst is.  See mailcfg script to manage
# the aliases and for the SQL table declarations.

dbpath = {{ mail_db }}
query = SELECT dst FROM aliases WHERE src='%s'
