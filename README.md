# DaveCloud Mail, Web, and Backup

These Ansible roles set up web service, email, and regular backups.
Typically, mail and web are in the cloud while backups are run by a
machine in your physical posession.

I've been around since bits were big, but let my sysadmin skills get a
bit stale as others handled those duties.  It was time to refresh.
Cargo-cult recipes are quick, but rarely lead to knowledge.  I took a
slower path, working through each area to craft something that I
understood and reflected my own priorities.  Also got a pretty good
handle on Ansible.

The [DOCS directory](https://david-loffredo.github.io/davecloud/)
explains what I learned along the way.  Think of this as a travel
journal, with funny pictures of my old hardware.  I hope it is a
useful starting point for your own journey.
