# DaveCloud Server Configuration

These Ansible roles set up web service, email, and regular backups.
Typically, mail and web are on a machine in the cloud (AWS, Linode,
DigitalOcean, etc.) while backups are run by a machine that you have
physical control over (old PC or Raspberry Pi in your basement)

I've been around the net since before HTTP was a thing, but let my
sysadmin skills get stale as others handled those duties.  It was time
to refresh.  This project is the result of that journey.

It is easy to become a cargo-cult sysadmin by just searching for
recipes on the net until you get something that works.  It may be
quick, but your choices are never quite your own.

I took a slower path.  I read the recipes and documentation, asked
questions, ran tests, and then made my own choices.  Also got a pretty
good handle on Ansible.  The [docs
directory](https://david-loffredo.github.io/davecloud/) describes what
I learned along the way.  Think of this as my travel journal.

May it inspire you to take a journey yourself.
