# DaveCloud Mail, Web, and Backup

I've been on the net since well before HTTP was a thing, but let my
sysadmin skills get a bit stale as others handled those daily duties.
It was time to refresh.  This is the result of that journey.

These Ansible roles set up web service, email, and regular backups.
Typically, mail and web are in the cloud while backups are run by a
machine in your physical posession.

It is tempting to become a cargo-cult sysadmin. Following recipes
found on the net is quick, but does not lead to knowledge.  I took a
slower path, working through each piece to craft something that I
understood and reflected my own priorities.  Also got a pretty good
handle on Ansible.

The [DOCS directory](https://david-loffredo.github.io/davecloud/)
explains what I learned along the way.  Think of this as a travel
journal, with funny pictures of my old hardware.  I hope it is a
useful starting point for your own journey.
