# LowCloud Mail, Web, and Backup

These Ansible roles set up mail and web service in the cloud, with
backups from a separate machine. Requirements are low, with few extra
frills, and should appeal to anyone comfortable with stone knives and
bearskins.  My three goals for this exercise were:

- Basic mail and web for one or more domains, 
- Built securely with modern packages, and proper backups,
- A clear description of what is on the machine and why.

The [DOCS directory](https://david-loffredo.github.io/lowcloud/)
describes what is there, how to configure it, and why I chose it, with
some fun pictures of my old hardware at the bottom of each page.
